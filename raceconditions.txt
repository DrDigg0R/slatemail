Avoiding a race condition

Possible user actions:

- Mark an email as complete (change its flags)
- Delete an email
- Move an email (aka delete and append to another mailbox)
- Delete a mailbox
- Add a mailbox

The expectation is that these actions must be reflected in the local client IMMEDIATELY.

However, you must avoid a race condition that would temporarily undo these actions mid-sync.

Do these actions create race conditions with the syncing process?
