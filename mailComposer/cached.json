Please join me in congratulating Chris Kirk on the official publication today of his totally fun, funny, fascinating, and\n<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2015/02/email_overload_building_my_own_email_app_to_reach_inbox_zero.html\">\nprovocative Fresca</a> about his quixotic attempt to build his own email app. It's a&nbsp;chronicle of an impossible programming challenge that transforms into a meditation on the role email plays in all our lives, and the way this decades-old technology has become,\n as Chris calls it, \"a beast of burden\" onto whose back we've piled every kind of communication imaginable. He ends with a call to arms for citizens to rethink the way they use email that I'm going to start adhering to, just as soon as I send this email.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>We all knew that Chris was an expert maker of interactives and a generator of clever ideas. But you maybe did not know what an elegant and funny writer he is! As a piece of tech writing for lay readers, his essay is splendid: While I was reading it, I was\n expertly fooled into believing that I actually understood the complicated infrastructure of email and the reasons it's such a mess. Through smart analogies, great visuals, and patient and careful writing, Kirk has written a piece that's a model of informed\n argumentation </p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>The piece came together with a lot of support: from John Swansburg, who signed off on this somewhat odd but exciting pitch; Dan Check and other members of the dev team who offered helpful advice along the way; Julia Turner, who top-edited and asked all the\n right questions; Juliana Jiménez, who took those great photos; Holly Allen, who generated all the wonderful design elements, including the photo illustrations using Alex Eben Meyer's buzzing B-mails; Meg Wiegand, who copy-edited&nbsp;it carefully&nbsp;and also took&nbsp;charge\n of a very complicated publication process; and Jennifer Lai, who put together three terrific Plus bonuses, including a podcast where Kirk gets to vent at me for cutting a section of his piece.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Congrats Chris! Everyone else, PLEASE read and share and tweet and Like and congratulate Chris as well.<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<div id=\"Signature\">\n<div name=\"divtagdefaultwrapper\" style=\"font-family:Calibri,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:; margin:0\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\nDan Kois<br>\nSlate<br>\n1350 Connecticut Ave NW #400<br>\nWashington DC 20036</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</span>\n\n\n</blockquote>","cc":"\"Kirk, Chris\"&lt;chris.kirk@slate.com&gt;"}
