-- To-Do -- 
[ ] Optimize threading so that the threading process checks the email's current mailbox first, then the INBOX.
[ ] Automatically delete empty scheduled boxes
[ ] Use multiple IMAP connections to speed up syncing?
[ ] Stop mailComposer acting like a separate process
[ ] Make a smarter scheduler (allow the user to type in days, e.g. "tuesday")
[ ] Improve promise implementation in various old functions in dbHandler
[ ] Add a way to remove a thread from a project
[x] Make folders collapsible
[ ] Add a search function
[ ] Seems to be a problem in which the whole SlateMail database gets wiped if the user quits during the syncing process, possibly during the flags update.
[ ] Find a way to sync project data?
[ ] Make more efficient way to mark printed thread messages seen (so they do not need to retrieved again)
