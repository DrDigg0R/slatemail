SlateMail is an experimental email client. It runs on Node using nw.js. I wrote about the project on Slate.com.

SlateMail is super buggy.

Under the hood, it's cobbled together using various Node modules, including node-imap, mailparser, and nodemailer.

Over the hood, it's cobbled together using features from various email clients, including Apple Mail, Gmail, Mail Pilot, and Dropbox's Mailbox.
